        "title3": "The importance of ongoing PFAS monitoring",
        "desc3": "PFAS are often inaccurately called “Forever Chemicals”. This is because many of them take a long time to break down in the environment. They also can take a long time to be eliminated from the human body. The key measure here is called the elimination half-life. Elimination half life is a measure of how much time it takes for a compound to be removed from the body. PFAS compounds sometimes have half lives measured in years if not decades.",
        "desc4": "If a compound has a half life of 2 years that means after 2 years, half of it is still in the body. And after 4 years a quarter is left. As a rule of thumb, scientists say that it takes five half-lives to effectively eliminate a chemical compound from the body. So, for many PFAS it takes decades for them to be eliminated. However, some modern PFAS compounds have far shorter half lives in the body. Therefore, by taking the steps above, you should see your blood levels dropping within a few months. The generally accepted advice is for most people to take a test once or twice per year. Those in high risk occupations or living in high contamination areas should consider taking tests 3 or 4 times a year."
